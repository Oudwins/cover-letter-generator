This file is treated as a template string evaluated in javascript.
Every line will be a new paragraph
The first line is generally the line that contains the greeting.
In this file you will have access to the ${data} variable. Which contains all the metadata for the current letter. (check the full data at ./src/TemplateData.d.ts). 
Don't forget to check & create fallbacks for when the data is not defined like
${data.to ? "Dear " + data.to.name + "," : "To Whom it May Concern,"}
